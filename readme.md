# Spring Boot Starter Template

The idea of this template is to allow starting new projects
very quickly with sensible defaults while still remaining
scalable and splittable.

If you find it too bloated for your needs - feel free to
delete what you don't need. Deleting is easier than
implementing something from scratch without having prior
experience.
